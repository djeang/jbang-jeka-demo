# JBang-JeKa combo demo

This project demonstrates how [JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/) can be used in conjunction with [JeKa](https://jeka.dev) to 
build a basic Spring-Boot project.

To run this demo, you have to install JBang, then run the following command from this base directory.

```shell
jbang Build.java
```

This will compile, test, and run the Spring-Boot application.
